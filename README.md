Flight Delay Analysis
Project Overview
This project analyzes flight delay data to uncover patterns in airline and airport performance. Using Python, the analysis explores departure and arrival delays across airlines, airports, months, weeks, and hours of the day. Visualizations are generated to highlight trends and provide insights into on-time performance, delay patterns, and potential influencing factors.
The dataset (flights_cleaned.csv) contains flight records with details such as airline names, departure and arrival delays, origin and destination airports, and timestamps. The script (flight_analysis.py) processes this data and generates visualizations saved in the figures/ directory.
Insights
1. Airline On-Time Performance

Comparison of Airlines:

Best Performers: Alaska Airlines Inc. has the lowest average arrival delay at approximately -10 minutes, followed by Hawaiian Airlines Inc. at -7 minutes, and American Airlines Inc. at 2 minutes. For departure delays, US Airways Inc. and Hawaiian Airlines Inc. perform best, with delays around 2.5-5 minutes.
Worst Performers: Frontier Airlines Inc. shows the highest average delays for both departure and arrival, around 20 minutes each, followed by Airtran Airways Corporation and Mesa Airlines Inc.

Yearly Trends:

June and July are the most frequent months for delays across most airlines. SkyWest Airlines Inc. experiences its highest delays in January, with departure delays peaking at around 60 minutes and arrival delays at 100 minutes.
Monthly average delays peak in July (departure at 20 minutes, arrival at 17 minutes), with lows in September (arrival at -5 minutes) and November (departure at 5 minutes).
Weekly delays peak around weeks 24-26 (mid-year) and drop to -10 to 2 minutes around week 40.

2. Delay Trends Across Time

Monthly Trends: Delays peak in July (20 minutes departure, 17 minutes arrival), followed by June. September and November show the lowest delays, possibly due to reduced travel demand or better weather conditions.
Weekly Trends: Weeks 24-26 (mid-year) see the highest delays, likely due to summer travel peaks, while week 40 (early fall) has the lowest delays.
Hourly Trends: Delays peak between 18:00-21:00 (departure at 25 minutes, arrival at 15-20 minutes) and are lowest at 5:00-7:00 (0-5 minutes), suggesting evening scheduling or operational challenges.
Potential Reasons: Seasonal weather (e.g., summer storms), holiday travel surges, and evening congestion may contribute to these trends.

3. Airport Punctuality

Comparison:
Origin Airports: EWR, JFK, and LGA have the highest departure delays (14, 12, and 10 minutes, respectively), likely due to high traffic volume in the New York area.
Destination Airports: CAE, TUL, and OKC show the highest arrival delays (40, 35, and 30 minutes), while LEX (-20 minutes), SNA, and STT are the most punctual.


Influencing Factors: High-delay airports (e.g., EWR, CAE) may face congestion due to hub status or location (e.g., northern climates with winter weather). Low-delay airports (e.g., LEX, HNL) benefit from lower traffic or efficient operations.
Patterns: Airports with high traffic (e.g., EWR, JFK) consistently show delays, while smaller or less busy airports (e.g., LEX) perform better.

4. Recommendations

Airlines: Frontier and ExpressJet should investigate operational inefficiencies, especially in July and evening hours. Alaska and Hawaiian Airlines could share best practices for early arrivals.
Airports: High-delay airports (EWR, CAE) should improve traffic management, possibly through staggered scheduling or infrastructure upgrades. Study low-delay airports (LEX, SNA) for optimization strategies.
Seasonal Planning: Increase resources in June-July and weeks 24-26 to handle peak delays. Use September-November and week 40 for maintenance or training.
Further Analysis: Examine weather, traffic volume, and route-specific data to identify delay causes. Predictive modeling for 15-minute departure delays and deeper feature analysis (e.g., time of day, distance) could provide additional insights.

Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository:git clone https://github.com/pythonist4444/flights_delay_analysis.git
cd flights_analysis


Install Dependencies:Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Install the required libraries:pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy


Prepare the Dataset:
Place the flights.csv file in the root directory of the repository.
The script expects columns like name, dep_delay, arr_delay, month, day, year, hour, origin, and dest.


Run the Script:python flights_analysis.py

This will generate visualizations in the figures/ directory.

Repository Structure

flights_analysis.py: Main script for data analysis and visualization.
flights_cleaned.csv: Dataset containing flight delay records (not included in the repository due to size; add your own).
figures/: Directory containing generated visualizations (PNG files).
README.md: Project documentation and insights.

Future Work: flights_analysis_ml.py

Implement predictive modeling to forecast 15-minute departure delays.
Analyze underlying factors influencing delays, such as route-specific disruptions, time of day, distance, or carrier policies.
Incorporate external data (e.g., weather, air traffic control) for deeper insights.
